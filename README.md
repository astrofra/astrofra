> I am highly interested in interactive digital media, especially when the same piece of hardware helps to build a project and run it! The immediate and unpredictable aspect of software is similar to a _performance_, and I have always enjoyed navigating this uncertain territory. However, using constantly evolving digital tools shouldn't be the ultimate goal. Practicing them thoroughly should also involve critical thinking to understand their strengths and weaknesses.<br>
<br>
Having been trained in both computer programming and graphic design, I have aimed to bridge the gap between technology and artistic expression throughout my career.

<br>

## What I do _for a living_

<br>

### **2018 - Present** HARFANG 3D (Project Lead)

HARFANG 3D is a 3D engine for industrial applications. I work on
architecture, features, user interface, and documentation.
I also contribute to client projects utilizing HARFANG.

One of my tasks involved co-developing a production workflow for industrializing virtual reality training, connecting 3D content, interaction points, and scripts. The linear scripts describe the training from a business perspective and associate concrete actions with each interaction point. I led a team of 3 people: a C++ developer, a 3D graphic designer, and a technical artist.

<br>

### **1999 - 2018** Movida Production (Technical artist)

- Writing specifications, creating prototypes, 3D modeling and integration, business implementation on a range of professional driving simulators.
- Automated 3D packshot POC for retail (based on Renderman) and then co-development of the industrialized version (based on Mental Ray).
- Writing specifications, testing, and deploying a real-time 3D CPU engine applied to 3D packshots.

<br>

### ***1995*** Microids, Fort Boyard – 'The Challenge'

In the summer of 1995, I worked on the adaptation project of Fort Boyard for PC MS-DOS as a C language developer. The Microïds team had just set up a 2D C/ASM framework, with which I worked in complete autonomy, from integrating graphical elements, implementing gameplay and display, to diagnosing occasional bugs within the framework.

<sub>_Screenshots of two challenges completed during my mission and the game cover._</sub><br>

### ***1994*** Silmarils, Ishar 3 CD-Rom

At Silmarils during the summer of 1994, I created the intro cinematic sequence for Ishar III CD-ROM as a 3D graphic designer.
My role was to build the complete 3D animation sequence. The result I delivered was integrated as is. Initially started as an internship, this mission was compensated in the form of a freelance assignment.

<br>

## What I do _for fun_

<br>

### ***2022*** Marine Melodies

A contemplative audiovisual work based on nine audio tracks from a collective of musicians. HARFANG 3D is used here to generate an interactive interface. Presented at EVOKE 2022 (Köln) and in 2023 at XUL/Labomedia (Orléans).

<br>

### ***2018 - 2021*** Athanor 2

Creation of a homebrew video game and self-publishing for Amiga and Atari ST, with Eric Safar (former lead dev on the Atlantis series, Cryo). Contrary to modern 3D engines, this return to the roots provided me with the opportunity to combine C code, Python tool creation, and digital painting.

![](img/work-perso-002.png)<br>

<br>

### ***2013*** Within the Mesh (of Eryx)

A derivative work inspired by a Lovecraft short story and an emblematic demoscene production, using some of its "open" 3D files. It won 2nd place at Evoke 2013 in the "PC Demos" competition. I aimed to convey the sensations suggested by reading the short story through a first-person perspective sequence. Produced with the help of a 3D artist and a musician.

<br>

### ***2012*** Amiga Memories

Amiga Memories is a solo video project developed around historical elements of the Commodore Amiga personal computer. The videos are 100% generated from a written script, a 3D engine, and a TTS.
By early 2023, the YouTube videos of the Amiga Memories project have amassed 11,000 views. The 3D models are mostly borrowed.

<br>

### ***2009 - 2014*** Game Jams

From 2011 to 2014, I participated in the Paris edition of the Global Game Jam, an event that challenges developers and creatives to create a video game based on a given theme over a weekend:
- 2014, _ColorCycler_, created with Douglas Alves and Florian Dufour
- 2013, _VRLux_, I joined Judith Guez's team and discovered her narrative approach  
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQabwjQMbag
- 2012, _Jurasnake Park_, where I took on the role of coder in a team of 3
- 2011, _Light Cylinders_, first experience with GGJ and Unity3D

My first game jam experience took place in 2009, at the BigJam in Berlin, organized by the TigSource community. The games were developed in 3 hours, but mine took the entire weekend:
- 2009: _Transparent Aluminium Starfield_, created with GameStart 3D, in a team with Sven Ruthner and Brandon McCartin

<br>

### ***2011 - 2012*** Astrolander

Astrolander is a solo video game developed on the GameStart3D framework (pre-release version of HARFANG 3D) during 2011-2012, motivated by the dynamics of the TigSource community. Presented at the Independent Games Festival in 2013 and "Greenlit" by the Steam community.
Starting with the classic "Lunar Lander" mechanics, I updated the protagonist's physical behavior by adapting the controls and gameplay and eliminating the main frustration factors.

<br>

### ***2006 - 2009*** Game Prototypes & Game Jams

Inspired by the themes proposed by the TigSource.com forum, I designed and developed 4 experimental games, each over a one-month period, utilizing a custom real-time 3D engine:
- Mediécross, TigContest "A game by its cover", a reinterpretation of the game "Metrocross"
- Flyin'Island, TigContest "Cockpit compo"
- Der Erlkonig, TigContest "The Commonplace book" by H. P. Lovecraft
- VipeÜt, TigContest "Demake", a reimagined WipeOut for the Vectrex

<br>

### ***2001 - 2005*** Polygonal 3D Writing

Starting with basic modeling for real-time 3D, I developed a personal writing style using global illumination, which was just becoming available in Lightwave 3D and added texture to 3D rendering.
In 2004, Steve and Raf Anzovin, 3D producers and animators, offered to include my work in 3D Toons, an anthology of techniques and graphic approaches in the production of 3D cartoons, published by Ilex Press.

<br>

### ***1996 - 2003*** Demoscene

Starting in 1996, I began to maintain a virtuous exchange between my professional activities and my personal production, particularly within the demoscene by participating in creative competitions involving live code, judged by various rankings, including:
- Red Line, 2nd place at Equinoxe2003, exploratory graphic hybridization
- Couloir14, 2nd place at VIP2001, a caricatural exploration of conspiracy theories
- Caillou, 8th place at LTP2000, a real-time cel-shaded stroll

![](img/work-perso-008.png)<br>
<sub>_Screenshots of "Caillou" and "Couloir 14", created within the context of the demoscene, a playground for artistic experimentation between code and spectacle, but still very male-dominated. (photo by Matti Palosuo, 2000)_</sub><br>

During this period, I mainly contributed to projects as a graphic artist, using Lightwave 3D as my primary tool and striving to bring graphic unity.

Together with Jean-Michel Hervé† (pictured left), we repurposed low-poly constraints to approach the writing style of comic books, far from futile attempts to achieve realism.
In Couloir 14, entirely created in Lightwave and replayed by a custom 3D engine, I took advantage of a conversion-free workflow to iterate very quickly and independently experiment with a visual genre where light, material, and typography form a coherent pictorial ensemble.

<br>

## Studies

In parallel with my higher education, I was able to combine professional experiences in the video game industry with visits to the Imagina festival in Monte-Carlo in 1994 and 1995. Contact with professionals at the shows, the opportunity to test the first virtual reality headsets, to see the first real-time graphics accelerators, and to attend the Prix Pixel INA evenings were a powerful motivation boost.

<br>

### ***1995-1999*** ESAD Orléans, National Diploma in Fine Arts
<sub>_(Formerly Institut d’Art Visuel d’Orléans)_</sub>

During the curriculum offered by IAV, including traditional techniques practice (drawing, painting, photography, video), I was able to self-train in 3D computer graphics on Amiga hardware. The machine was already obsolete, which allowed me to have a configuration close to a workstation for a budget compatible with a student's. My practice of Lightwave 3D resulted in various productions and participations in specialized press such as Amiganews or in newsletters with more confidential distribution.

<br>

### ***1993-1995*** University Paris Cité, Computer Science Degree
<sub>_(Formerly Paris V, Université Descartes)_</sub>

In 1993, the computer science taught at Paris V was based on professional hardware radically different from the general public's microcomputers. These 2 years were a unique opportunity for me to approach tools such as Bull mini-computers or IBM mainframes, accessible from passive terminals. Bearing no resemblance to anything known, except the first UNIX systems, these tools helped me broaden my frame of reference and still give me some perspective on the recent evolution of technologies.
